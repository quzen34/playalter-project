- **AR Integration**: None, basic, overlays, and full AR overlay support
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second face mask generation with streaming

#### Intelligent Orchestration Methods
```python
async def orchestrate_mask_stream(body: {input_image, options: {ethnic, quality, AR}}):
    # Master decides workflow, Replicate produces mask, Agora streams result
    return {"swapped_url": "...", "stream_token": "..."}
```

#### New API Endpoints
