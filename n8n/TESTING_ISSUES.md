# N8N Testing Issues and Solutions

## Current Issue: HTTP 401 Authentication Required

When testing the N8N endpoints, we're getting HTTP 401 responses from the Vercel deployment. This indicates authentication is required.

## Possible Causes:

1. **Vercel Authentication Middleware**: The deployment might have auth protection
2. **Environment Variables**: Missing or incorrect API keys
3. **CORS Issues**: Cross-origin request blocking
4. **Deployment Status**: App might be in protected/preview mode

## Testing Solutions:

### Option 1: Use Local Development Server
```bash
# Start local Flask server
cd backend
python app_enhanced.py

# Test locally (usually port 5000)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/orchestrate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "face_processing", "face_mask": true}'
```

### Option 2: Update Vercel Deployment URL
The current URL appears to be a preview deployment. We need the production URL:
```
Current: https://playalter-g9xtgp20l-fatihs-projects-9166e25f.vercel.app
Expected: https://www.playalter.com (when domain is configured)
```

### Option 3: Configure Authentication Headers
If authentication is required, add headers:
```bash
curl -X POST https://playalter-g9xtgp20l-fatihs-projects-9166e25f.vercel.app/api/n8n/agent-orchestrate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"type": "face_processing", "face_mask": true}'
```

### Option 4: Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Login to Vercel dashboard
2. Check deployment status
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Check if domain is properly configured
5. Review deployment logs for errors

## Updated Testing Strategy:

For now, we'll focus on:
1. **Local testing** of the orchestration logic
2. **N8N workflow import** (independent of Vercel)
3. **Webhook configuration** for when deployment is accessible

## N8N Workflow Testing (Independent):
Once N8N workflows are imported, they can be tested directly in N8N interface without relying on the Vercel deployment.

## Production Deployment Checklist:
- [ ] Verify Vercel deployment is accessible
- [ ] Check environment variables are configured
- [ ] Confirm domain routing (www.playalter.com)
- [ ] Test authentication requirements
- [ ] Validate N8N webhook endpoints

## Next Steps:
1. Import N8N workflows (can be done independently)
2. Fix Vercel deployment authentication
3. Test complete integration once accessible
